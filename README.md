# Deep Learning – Summer 2024 (NYCU)

This repository contains assignments, projects, and code implementations for the **Deep Learning** course offered at **National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (NYCU)** during **Summer 2024**.


### Lab1:
- Only use Numpy and the python standard libraries to implement simple neural networks with forwarding pass and backpropagation.


### Lab2:
- Predict motor imagery task by training SCCNet model using deep learning techniques.

### Lab3:

- I design the ResNet, UNet architecture to recognize the animal picture.
And also preprocess the dataset like image flipping and image scaling.
- Finally use Dice score to evaluate model’s performance.

### Lab4:

- Need to implement conditional video prediction in a VAE-based model.

### Lab5:

- Implement MaskGIT for the inpainting task.
- Image contain gray regions indicating missing information, which we aim to restore using MaskGIT.
- **Focus on:** Multi-head attention, transformer training, and inference inpainting.

### Lab6:
- Need to implement a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) to generate synthetic images.
